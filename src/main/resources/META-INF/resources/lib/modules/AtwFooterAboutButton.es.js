At a point, I decided to ask each of my penpals to draw a flag of the country they were writing from and send it back to me. Eventually, after collecting all of them, I could get a huge poster, hanging on my room's wall, showing me the colors of the world I was in touch with. This project is inspired by those times.</p><p> Where are my co-workers worldwide living? What's going on at their location right now? How can I get to know better other Liferay offices worldwide countries?</p><p>And also: What's going on at my location at the moment? Howcan I get useful information, all in one place?</p><p><strong>Around the World</strong> would like to cover this needs and encourage the global mutual knowledge of our countries. The name is inspired by a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_(Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers_song)' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>popular song of the late 90's</a></p><p>More on GitHub: <a href='https://github.com/alffox/liferay-around-the-world-react' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>https://github.com/alffox/liferay-around-the-world-react</a></p>",
