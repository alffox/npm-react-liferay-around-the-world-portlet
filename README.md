## Purpose of this project

Back in late 90's when having an internet connection was not always possible, I used to get to know people from all over the world through paper letters. At a point, I decided to ask each of my penpals to draw a flag of the country they were writing from and send it back to me. Eventually, after collecting all of them, I could get a huge poster, hanging on my room's wall, showing me the colors of the world I was in touch with. This project is inspired by those times.

Where are my co-workers worldwide living? What's going on at their location right now? How can I get to know better other Liferay offices in worldwide countries? What's going on at my location at the moment? How can I get useful information, all in one place?

**Liferay Around the World** would like to cover this needs and encourage the global mutual knowledge of our countries. The name is inspired by a popular song of the late 90's: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_(Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers_song)

## How to run the app?

1. Clone the project on your machine: `git clone https://github.com/alffox/npm-react-liferay-around-the-world-portlet.git`
2. Navigate to the root directory: `cd npm-react-liferay-around-the-world-portlet/`
3. Compile the portlet with `./gradlew clean build` (Unix-Linux) or `gradlew.bat clean build` (Windows)
4. Locate the deployable .jar file within `npm-react-liferay-around-the-world-portlet/build/libs`
5. Place the .jar file in the `deploy` directory of your Liferay home folder
6. Wait for successful deployment by checking the server logs
7. Place the portlet onto a page by clicking on the top-right "+" icon > Add > Widgets > Sample > NpmReactLiferayAroundTheWorld

(Note: After the above steps, the Google Maps card will not render. To fix that, edit the value within the double quotes at https://github.com/alffox/npm-react-liferay-around-the-world-portlet/blob/master/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/lib/modules/MapContainer.es.js#L31 by replacing "redacted" with your Google Maps API key and have that key enabled on the host where you wish to run the website (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) )

## Can I edit the location list?

Yes. To add or modify locations:

1. Edit the `locationsData` variable at https://github.com/alffox/npm-react-liferay-around-the-world-portlet/blob/master/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/lib/index.es.js#L15 by populating the json array with the location of your choice:
